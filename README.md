## 👋🏾 Hi, I'm Miracle !

🎓 I'm a Computer Science student at **UFPB (Universidade Federal da Paraíba)**, currently in my **2nd period**, i must say, there's so much more to discover in this journey."


🧠 I'm still exploring my path in tech, but I know this:
- I love **design**, especially when it meets purpose.
- I'm **curious**, eager to learn, and not afraid to try new things.
- I'm beginning to enjoy working on **projects with others**, discovering how group problem-solving can bring ideas to life.
- Sometimes I dive deep into complex topics and I enjoy the challenge of understanding them.

🛠️ I'm currently learning and improving in:
- Frontend Development (HTML, CSS , JS, Python)
- Git & GitHub (👋🏾 hey, still figuring this place out!)
- UI/UX Principles

✨ I'm excited and passionate about growing, exploring the vast world of technology, collaborate, and finding where I can make meaningful impacts with love and purpose✨ 

> “Don’t despise small beginnings, every day is a new chance to grow, learn and **bloom**".
